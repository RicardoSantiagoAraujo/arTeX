###  Universal writing style tips for body:
- Reduce sentences!!!
- pyramid structure: from the particular to the general!!!
- Subdivide into smaller titled sections: bonus point of section title is lifted from the text
- Some suspence is OK, but the chapeau should include the who/what/where/when directly. Leave the suspence for the why/how
- Avoid the passive voice... it is more difficult to read
